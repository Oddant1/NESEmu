1. Interface:
    - As simple as possible, pass path to ROM at command line

2. CPU
    - ???

3. PPU
    - ???

4. MEMORY
    - ???

5. AUDIO
    - ???


STEPS:
    1. Set up CPU
        - Set up main loop and instructions
        - Probably gonna need some tests.

    1. Loading and reading .NES files
        - This needs to be done first because without it nothing is really testable

    2. Set up memory
        - Loading ROM into RAM on a basic level
        - The different memory mapping schemes can be dealt with later
            - We probably want to load the entire ROM into memory and then map to emulator memory from RAM not disk
