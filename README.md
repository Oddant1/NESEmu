# NESEmu
Putting this here so I'm obligated to work on it

NOTE: There is a Makefile now, at some point I will be using CMake, but that won't be necessary until I get to actually rendering things which is a LONG way off

Plan: Follow the steps layed out by this guy https://yizhang82.dev/nes-emu-overview

Interface: Just pass path to ROM from command line. Simplest interface.
